			<h1>Graduate Student Application Process</h1>

			<p>Deadlines for applications for fall admission to graduate programs 
			   (the most common start time) are usually in January or February of 
			   that year, and sometimes even in November or December of the 
			   preceeding year. For international students especially, with extra 
			   paperwork required, it is important to begin the application process 
			   as early as possible, in most cases in the early fall of your 
			   senior year as an undergraduate student.
			 </p>

			<p>Since graduate programs vary, and requirements for masters and Ph.D. 
			   programs vary, each program will require specific information. 
			   However, there are some general trends. You will need to complete an 
			   online application, send transcripts and recommendation letters, 
			   take the TOEFL, and submit bank statements proving your family can 
			   afford the tuition. You will likely also have to write one or more 
			   essays, submit the titles of past scholarly or published work, 
			   explain your future research plans, take standardized tests such 
			   as the GRE, or have an interview.
