			<h1>Transfer Student Application Process</h1>

			<p>Some universities allow you to transfer only in the fall, while 
			   some allow spring transfers as well. If the university you want to 
			   attend has quarters instead of semesters, you may be able to 
			   transfer into any quarter: spring, summer, winter, or fall.
			 </p>

			<p>In general, transfer students need to submit an online application.
			   You also need transcripts, a TOEFL score, letters of recommendation, 
			   and a bank statement from your family showing you can afford to pay 
			   for tuition. Depending on the school or program you want to enter, 
			   you may need to write an essay, submit a portfolio, or have an 
			   interview.
