			<h1>Graduate Student</h1>

			<p>If you have already finished a four-year undergraduate degree,
			   commonly a BS or BA degree, you can apply for graduate school in 
			   the United States. Although most people with a BA or BS apply for a 
			   masters program, it is possible to apply directly to a Ph.D. program 
			   in some cases, or to a joint masters-Ph.D. program in others. 
			</p>

			<p>The length of graduate programs varies depending on the subject and 
			   the school. To get a teaching degree for public education in the 
			   United States, for example, typical masters programs are about one 
			   year long. Many other masters programs are two years long or more. 
			   Most Ph.D. programs are at least three years long, and some can be 
			   much longer, depending on research and practice requirements.
