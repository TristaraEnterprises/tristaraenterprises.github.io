It's possible to take extra classes if you have the permission of your advisor, but transfer students usually can't get permission during their very first semester, and international students may find it even more difficult to get permission, since the advisor wants to make sure you have transitioned well into the all-English environment before allowing you to take extra classes.</p><p>Each class counts as a certain number of credits, and instructors usually assign around three hours of homework such as reading or writing essays per hour of class; that means a 3-credit class will take up 12 hours of your week, each week. If English isn't your first language, that three hours of reading or writing per class hour can take closer to five, six, or more hours, so pace yourself. As a new international transfer student, don't try to take extra classes in your first semester until you get used to the heavy homework requirements in American universities.</p>";
