				<h2>Transfer Student Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

				<h3><span class="emphasize">Question:</span><br /><br />
					Where will I live?</h3>

				<p><span class="emphasize">Answer: </span><br /><br />
				   Most university freshmen and sophomores in the United States 				   	   live in dormitories on campus. Some universities even require 
				   freshmen and sophomores to live on campus.</p>

				<p>For schools that have no on-campus housing requirements, 
				   it may be possible to find an apartment or a host family to 
				   stay with, but these arrangements require more planning and 
				   finances. If you want to live off campus, let us know as 
				   soon as possible so that we can find universities that allow 
				   it if you will be transfering as a freshman or 
				   sophomore.</p>
