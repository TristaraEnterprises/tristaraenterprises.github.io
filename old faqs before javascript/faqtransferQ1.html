				<h2>Transfer Student Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

				<h3><span class="emphasize">Question:</span><br /><br />
					How good does my English have to be?</h3>

				<p><span class="emphasize">Answer: </span><br /><br />
				   Each school has a minimum or average TOEFL score for 
				   international students. Generally, the more prestigious the 
				   school, the higher a score you will need.</p>

				<p>However, if you have a strong application and the only thing 
				   that is weak is your English score, some schools may admit 
				   you conditionally, that is, they will admit you to their school 
				   for one semester or year and require you to take only ESL 
				   classes. If you can pass the ESL classes, then you will be 
				   admitted as a regular student for the following semester.</p>
