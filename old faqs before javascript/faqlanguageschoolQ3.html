				<h2>Language School Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

				<h3><span class="emphasize">Question:</span><br /><br />
					How long does it take to get good enough to transfer to a 
			   		university?</h3>

				<p><span class="emphasize">Answer: </span><br /><br />
				   This, of course, depends on your level when you begin. If you are only missing a few points for 
				   a qualifying TOEFL score, you will probably only need one semester of intensive study. If you are 
				   starting as a beginner or with a very low score, however, it may take around two years.</p>

				<p>If you are conditionally admitted to a college program, but you are required to take English 
				   classes first because your TOEFL score was not high enough, you will most likely not need to 
				   take the TOEFL again. Instead, your school will probably tell you that when you finish a 
				   certain level course with a high enough grade, you will then be ready to enter normal classes. 
				   Some schools may even let you take one or two normal classes at the same time as your English 
				   classes.</p>
