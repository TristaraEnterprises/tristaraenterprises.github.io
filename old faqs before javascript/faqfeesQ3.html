				<h2>Fees Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

				<h3><span class="emphasize">Question:</span><br /><br />
					Why do you charge extra for extra services? Why don't you include
			    		everything in the base fee?</h3>

				<p><span class="emphasize">Answer: </span><br /><br />
				   Not every student requires every service. In order to keep your cost 
				   as low as possible, we don't want to charge people for a service 
				   they don't need. Therefore, we charge our basic fee for all of the 
				   necessary services that everyone should use. If anyone wants extra 
				   services, they can pay for those services separately, so that others 
				   who don't want or need those services don't have to pay for them.</p>
