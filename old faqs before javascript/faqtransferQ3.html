				<h2>Transfer Student Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

				<h3><span class="emphasize">Question:</span><br /><br />
					Will I have to take classes or a year of school over 							again?</h3>

				<p><span class="emphasize">Answer: </span><br /><br />
				   It's possible. When you transfer, the American university 
				   will require that you get your previous college credits 
				   evaluated by an international association. Based on the 
			 	   results, they may give you equivalent credit at their 
				   university.</p>

				<p>If they determine that the credits are not equivalent, you 
				   will need to retake some classes at the American university. 
				   Depending on how many classes you need to retake, you may have 
				   to take a semester or year over again.</p>
