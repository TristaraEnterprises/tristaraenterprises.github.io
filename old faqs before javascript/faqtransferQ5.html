				<h2>Transfer Student Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

				<h3><span class="emphasize">Question:</span><br /><br />
					Can I transfer into an Ivy League School?</h3>

				<p><span class="emphasize">Answer: </span><br /><br />
				   Ivy League Schools such as Harvard or Yale have very high 
				   standards for admission and low acceptance rates. In general, 
				   even if you have excellent grades and speak English well, 
				   this alone is not enough to get into an Ivy League school. 
				   Every student who applies has those qualifications.</p>

				<p>If you want to apply to an Ivy League school, you should have 
				   extra-curricular activities or clubs in your background. 
				   Leadership in student government or other groups is also good 
				   experience. Volunteer and work experience counts for you. 
				   Showing your passion and having clear goals for the future in 
				   your application materials such as an essay or personal 
				   statement can help you reach the top of the pile.</p>
