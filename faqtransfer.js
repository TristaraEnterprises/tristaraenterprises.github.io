Generally, the more prestigious the school, the higher a score you will need.</p><p>However, if you have a strong application and the only thing that is weak is your English score, some schools may admit you conditionally, that is, they will admit you to their school for one semester or year and require you to take only ESL classes. If you can pass the ESL classes, then you will be admitted as a regular student for the following semester.</p>";

When you transfer, the American university will require that you get your previous college credits evaluated by an international association. Based on the results, they may give you equivalent credit at their university.</p><p>If they determine that the credits are not equivalent, you will need to retake some classes at the American university.

In general, even if you have excellent grades and speak English well, this alone is not enough to get into an Ivy League school. Every student who applies has those qualifications.</p><p>If you want to apply to an Ivy League school, you should have extra-curricular activities or clubs in your background. Leadership in student government or other groups is also good experience. Volunteer and work experience counts for you.

Some universities even require freshmen and sophomores to live on campus.</p><p>For schools that have no on-campus housing requirements, it may be possible to find an apartment or a host family to stay with, but these arrangements require more planning and finances.
