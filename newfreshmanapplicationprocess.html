			<h1>New Freshman Application Process</h1>

			<p>American students begin applying to universities one year before
			   they plan to enter college. For example, if you plan to enter 
			   college in the fall of 2016, you would begin the application process 
			   in the fall of 2015. For international students, it is important to 
			   begin the application process at least this early, and possibly 
			   earlier.
			 </p>

			<p>In general, freshmen need to complete an online application and 
			   submit an application fee. They must also take a standard test such 
			   as the SAT or ACT. International students also need to take an 
			   English test, usually the TOEFL. You need to submit your high 
			   school transcript(s), recommendation letters from teachers or other 
			   adults who know you well (not family), and a record of your 
			   extra-curricular activities such as sports, clubs, volunteer 
			   activities, work experience, competitions, or other interesting 
			   information that can set you apart from other students. You may 
			   need to write an essay or have a phone or online interview. Finally, 
			   international students need to submit bank statements proving their 
			   family can pay for tuition.
