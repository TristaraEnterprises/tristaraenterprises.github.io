			<h1>Our Fees</h1>

			<p>Applying to study in a foreign country can be expensive, but it 
			   doesn't have to cost a fortune. Since our company is run by
			   both Americans with graduate level degrees and university teaching
			   experience and Chinese with graduate level study experience in 			   	   America, we know the process well. We charge one flat fee for our 			 	   basic service, whether you are applying as a new college freshman, a 			   transfer student, a graduate student, or whether you want to attend 			 	   a language institute.
			</p>

			<p>Our fee: <span class="emphasize">$2,800</span> per student. 
			   (That's just <span class="emphasize">16,000 RMB</span>.)</p>

			<p>How can our fee be so much less than most college recruitment 
			   agency chains in China? We work hard to keep costs down. For one 				   thing, we don't have hundreds of offices that we have to maintain.
			   We are a modern company that saves costs by operating mostly online,
			   using Skype and email as our main forms of communication with
			   clients. In addition, we don't have a large corporate structure
			   of managers and owners who take a salary but don't actually assist
			   you much in applying for schools. Finally, we know that the real
			   price of applying for a university in America simply doesn't cost 
			   that much, and our goal is to help you find a school in an
			   affordable manner.
			</p>

			<p class="smallerFont"><span class="emphasize">Other Fees:</span> In addition to our 
			   basic package, we offer extra services for an extra fee. 
			</p>

			<ul class="smallerFont">
				<li>Applications to More Than Five Schools: $200 per Extra 
				    School, Plus Application Fees</li>
				<li>Assistance Registering for Classes for the First Semester: 
				    $200</li>
			</ul>
