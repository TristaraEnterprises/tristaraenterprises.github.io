			<h1>Transfer Student</h1>

			<p>If you have attended some college in your home country, then you 
			   can apply to universities in the United States as a transfer 
			   student. Most transfer student application deadlines are in 
			   February or March for the following Fall Term, so as an 
			   international student, you should begin the application process 
			   in the fall about one year before you hope to transfer.
			</p>

			<p>When you transfer, you can try to transfer your previous credits. 
			   American Universities require that your credtis be evaluated by an 
			   independent body to see if they are equivalent to the credits 
			   offered at their own institution. In some cases, all of your credits 
			   may not transfer and you may have to retake a class in America 
			   that you already took in your home country. In addition, while you 
			   may have been a junior or senior in your home institution, after 
			   you transfer, you may only be considered a sophomore or junior.
			   Therefore, transferring schools internationally usually means that 
			   you cannot finish your entire degree (begun in your home country) 
			   within four years.
